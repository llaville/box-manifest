# Use generated files produced by `bin/box-manifest` command

Begins by generate the manifest files.

1. First we will build a SBOM XML version following default (CycloneDX) specification 1.6

```shell
box-manifest build --config app-fixtures.box.json --output-file sbom.xml
```

2. Second we will build a decorated TEXT version

```shell
box-manifest build --config app-fixtures.box.json --output-file manifest.txt --output-format ansi
```

Now its turn to declare these files to the BOX config file, with :

```json
{
    "files-bin": ["sbom.xml", "manifest.txt"]
}
```

Then finally, compile your PHP Archive with `box compile` command,
the metadata contents is only used as fallback contents in case you forgot to declare `files-bin` entries.

For example :

```shell
vendor/bin/box compile --config app-fixtures.box.json.dist
```

To verify contents of PHAR `metadata` field, you can run following command with CLI

```shell
php -r "var_export((new Phar(getcwd() . '/app-fixtures.phar'))->getMetadata());"
```

And contents of binary files with following CLI command

```shell
php -r "var_export((new Phar(getcwd() . '/app-fixtures.phar'))['sbom.xml']->getContent());"
or
php -r "var_export((new Phar(getcwd() . '/app-fixtures.phar'))['manifest.txt']->getContent());"
```
