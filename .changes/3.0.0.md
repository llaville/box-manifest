## 3.0.0 - 2023-03-21

**BC breaks with this major version**

- Do not use anymore the `cweagans/composer-patches` composer-plugin to patch `humbug/box` at install time.
- This is a real standalone application with three distinct binary commands: `box-manifest`, `box-stub` and `box-compile`

Don't forget to read the documentation and its tutorial that will guide you to create your first manifest with its stub and compile in a PHAR.

### Added

- new Docker workflow to publish docker images to GitHub repository

### Changed

- Entrypoint in Dockerfile refer now to multiple commands
- org.opencontainers.image.version label is generated by docker workflow now (avoid hard-coding and outdated version number)
