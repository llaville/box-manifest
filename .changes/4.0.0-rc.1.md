## 4.0.0-rc.1 - 2024-09-04

**Road to stable version 4.0**

After almost one year since the latest 3.5.1 release, weâ€™re getting closer to BOX Manifest 4.0 !

This new major version is based on Pipeline Pattern implemented with excellent package <https://github.com/thephpleague/pipeline>

Read this good article <https://medium.com/@bonnotguillaume/software-architecture-the-pipeline-design-pattern-from-zero-to-hero-b5c43d8a4e60>,
if you are unconfortable with this design pattern.

An effort was made to write a better and enhanced documentation. Read it carefully at <https://llaville.github.io/box-manifest/4.0/>

All features are already included into this first release candidate.
So, if you want to improve this package before final stable version 4.0, please carefully test this version and report any issues found in the [bug reporting system](https://github.com/llaville/box-manifest/issues).

### Added
