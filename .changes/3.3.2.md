## 3.3.2 - 2023-04-04

### Fixed

- Cannot run application when command is launched from `vendor/bin/box-manifest` (composer `bin-dir` config)

**WARNING** Unless Composer added support to Symfony/Runtime, do not use `vendor/bin/box-manifest`
that will lead to a fatal error : see <https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/11416> for details

**Full Changelog**: [3.3.1...3.3.2](https://github.com/llaville/box-manifest/compare/3.3.1...3.3.2)
