## 4.1.0 - 2024-11-28

### Added

- `Bartlett\BoxManifest\Helper\BoxConfigurationHelper` class handle now the BOX configuration settings
  required by BOX Manifest instead of `Bartlett\BoxManifest\Helper\BoxHelper::getBoxConfiguration()`

### Changed

- BOX `alias` setting is internally set to **box-auto-generated-alias.phar** value, if not defined by BOX config file(s)

- Pipeline payload contents has changed :
  - **configuration** contains now an instance of `Bartlett\BoxManifest\Helper\BoxConfigurationHelper` instead of `KevinGH\Box\Configuration\Configuration`
  - **map** and **configurationFile** were removed (because can be internally retrieved by the new BoxConfigurationHelper)

- `Bartlett\BoxManifest\StubGenerator` removed dependency to legacy BOX `KevinGH\Box\StubGenerator`

- Use the `symfony/process` [ExecutableFinder](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/process.html#finding-an-executable) to find default `box` vendor binary

### Fixed

- Always use [`Phar::mapPhar`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/phar.mapphar.php) to solve an issue when BOX `alias` setting was not previously defined

### Removed

- `resources` directory, because template(s) are now handled internally by `Bartlett\BoxManifest\StubGenerator`
- `stub.php` file. Will now be generated on fly
